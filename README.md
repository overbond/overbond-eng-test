# overbond-eng-test
Usage:
open the file parse.py and run the file

Reasoning behind your technical choices:
I decided to use python for the language to do this coding problem because it can use the plot in the process of displaying.
I created multiple function for this problem. First is my parsing, I check the file, read through each line that has the needed info and 
return back to main.
I created a dictionary for the months so I can parse the date to the correct format.
I used matplotlib for creating the scatterplot.


Trade-offs you might have made or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project:
I would use hashtable, dynamic programming to improve in the time complexity if I get more time.
